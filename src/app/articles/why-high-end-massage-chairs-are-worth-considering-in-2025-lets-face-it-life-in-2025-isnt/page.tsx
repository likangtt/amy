            Let's face it – life in 2025 isn't getting any easier. With increasing work demands, digital fatigue, 
            and the constant pressure to stay connected, our bodies and minds are under more stress than ever before. 
            This is precisely why high-end massage chairs have become more than a luxury; they're a necessity for modern wellness.
          </p>

          <h2>The Reality of Modern Stress</h2>
          <p>
            The challenges we face in 2025 are unique to our generation:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Digital Overload:</strong> Hours spent hunched over screens, leading to "tech neck" and eye strain</li>
            <li><strong>Remote Work Syndrome:</strong> Poor home office ergonomics causing chronic back and shoulder pain</li>
            <li><strong>Always-On Culture:</strong> Difficulty disconnecting, leading to elevated stress hormones</li>
            <li><strong>Reduced Physical Activity:</strong> Sedentary lifestyles contributing to muscle stiffness and poor circulation</li>
          </ul>

          <div className="bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 p-6 my-6">
            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-red-900 mb-2">The Cost of Ignoring Stress</h3>
            <p className="text-red-800">
              Chronic stress and poor posture don't just affect how we feel today – they compound over time, 
              leading to serious health issues, decreased productivity, and reduced quality of life. 
              The question isn't whether you can afford a high-end massage chair; it's whether you can afford not to invest in one.
